# Introduction
---
Driven by a deep passion for physics and strong programming skills, my enthusiasm lies at the heart of solving
complex problems, particularly in statistical mechanics. While my programming skills are robust, my true devotion
is to the world of physics. I am committed to utilizing my programming insight to push the boundaries of what is
possible in this exciting discipline. Visit my blog here- [The Rest Frame](https://therestframe.tech/)

### __Self Propulsion of Active Droplets ([MSc Thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_nTlfJHk-Zi0dNoaQpHKjhqhH_bKkxWA/view?usp=drive_link))__

* Showing Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) in Binary Fluid using _Active Model H_.
* Implemented Spectral Method to solve coupled differential equations in three fields and simulate their dynamics in
Python.
* Simulated the self-propulsion of an Active Droplet under a dilute chemical field and low Reynolds’s number
approximation.
* Simulated the self-propulsion of an active Janus Droplet and analyzed the effect of the size and activity on propulsion speed.
* Simulated the self-propulsion of an active Janus Particle by extending the droplet theory using Fluid Particle Dynamics.
* Developed a generalized code and algorithm to explore self-propulsion using conserved field dynamics and low Reynolds’s number
approximation.

### __Monte Carlo Simulations__

+ Implemented Metropolis Algorithm to simulate the Ising Model in Python.
+ Verify the phase transition in the presence and absence of a magnetic field. Calculated the critical temperature for the
2-D and 3-D Ising models.
+ Showed the temperature dependence of magnetic moment and susceptibility.
+ Tested the model for various scales and verified the scaling hypothesis.

### __Simulatios for Ensambles__
+ __Micro-canonical Ensemble simulation:__ Showed the Maxwellian velocity distribution among hard spheres in a box
with weak interactions. Newton’s Laws were used to simulate the dynamics.
