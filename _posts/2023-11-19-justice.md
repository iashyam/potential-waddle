  \
Is struggle a justification for curruption\
Like oppression is for violence?\
Is majority enough to make a decision?\
Is injustice a just reply to injustice?\
  \
Why do innocent civilians suffer\
For the shitty steps of government?\
Why even children\
Who don't even vote?\
  \
Nations: Fancy drawings on maps \
Religion: Practices of unchallengable laws\
God: Answer to something you can't answer\
How is that all of any good\
If it leads to the death of fellow humans? \
  \
Can soap be cleaned using soap?\
Can killings be stopped by killings?\
  \
Is murder a fancy way to show off power?\
Is terror a meek method of seeking attention?\
Is majority enough to make a decision?\
Is struggle a justification for corruption?\
  \
How do we measure the value of a human's life?\
What is the standard international unit for it?\
What human being is more worthy than the other? \
Why is death of one more mourning\
Than the thousand of innocent civilians?\
  \
Why do people shut their eyes and ears\
When the fire is on neighbour's house\
While they know their fate is inescapable?\
Why is your problem problem of the world \
And the world's problem is not your problem?\
  \
  \
I openly stand against the killings of innocent humans in Palestine by Israel.
