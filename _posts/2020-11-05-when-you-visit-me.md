  \
Sitting on the bench under tree\
In the green field, you with me  
Sharing earphones and the song  
We spend time there, hours long.  
  
  
Talking and watching the sunset   
Shoulders make your head rest   
We take the dream of rest of life  
How good is having you as wife.\
  
  
Looking deep into your gray eyes  
Lethem go where the love birds fly  
Getting closer, then our lips met  
We love and love until it’s too late.\
  
  
We are in the full-of-cotton trolly   
Lying and seeing the sky endlessly  
Smiling to see the limits of the sky  
Sky can have limits but love can’t.\
  
  
In the cold night of the summer  
We talking about past and future  
Sleeping under sky counting stars  
Stars can have number but love can’t.\
  
  
Lost in each other making love fair  
Floating up because love is in the air.  
I close eyes kissing you in a feeling  
I open my eyes and find it is a dream.
