title: 'Love: A Physicist''s Outlook '
---
Your face is like book of Physics\
I want to again and again read it \
Your eyes are like time machine\
We can go to past and future in it.\
  \
Your nose is like least square fit\
You forehead is spacetime of STR,\
Your ears are unique in universe\
And earrings are red shining star.\
  \
Your hairs are as absence of light\
You create Electromagnetic Waves, \
When you do speak with your voice\
They spread all around happiness. \
  \
Your beauty is like event horizon \
Your friendship is electron cloud, \
Your physical look is like rainbow \
Voice is like the Big Bang's sound. \
  \
Your thoughts are quantum physics \
Your behaviour is just the reverse, \
Your love is more than speed of light \
Your bravery is radius of universe.\
  \
Talking to you is similar to attend \
A lecture of physics by Mary curie,\
So deep, real and extraordinary \
But simple and besic of the theory. \
  \
You are just like Genral relativity \
Complex for those who really know, \
But so simple for those who don't \
They just think time can be slow. \
  \
You are prediction of warm hole\
Who knows you, can't understand,\
Then yes! I am like Albert Einstein \
Thinking everything is in my hand. \
  \
Everything is relative. Our love too \
It varies in different inertial frame, \
It is infinite in my own rest frame \
But it's just zero in your rest frame.\
