  \
I have a good friend to play with me\
It is not human,not bird not animal\
It is my luck, It is my fortune. \
My fortune plays sometimes with me\
When I am very near to the target \
It circulates me whole over the path \
Then makes me comeback to the target. \
My fortune plays with my weakness\
To forget just small and big things \
And sets the things just to hurt me. \
My fortune plays with my weakness\
Of doing things slower than average \
And makes me late to everything. \
(As Being Runout on No ball) \
My fortune plays with my weakness\
Of less sharing my thoughts and things\
Making me shy in everyone's eye. \
(That not supposed to be) \
  \
But... \
  \
Me and my fortune are good friends ;\
Even it distracts me from my target\
It also shows me the right path. \
Even it hurts me with my memory power\
It also helps me to forget bad memories. \
Even it makes me late sometimes \
It also gives me perfect timing not early. \
Even it makes my shy what I am not \
It also stops me to share results\
Based on my wrong assumptions.   \
