  \
  \
  \
Keeping hope in my heart\
Having shine in my eyes\
I put a 'Hi' in the message box\
Before hitting the 'send' button\
My mind thinks again and again\
Collecting the courage to send\
As I hit the 'Send' button\
My heartbeat goes up and high.\
  \
This time, relativity plays a role\
Times slows down as I wait for it\
My eyes refuse to blink then\
Every second seems to be a year\
The horses of imagination flies\
Thinking what she may be doing\
Maybe she is with her parents \
Maybe she is with one she loves. \
  \
Then comes the moment here\
The status becomes 'online'\
And the eyes start to twinkle\
This was the one, I am waiting for!\
At this moment the time slows\
She is online but not replying.\
My heart starts to stop pumping\
Maybe she is chatting with someone.\
  \
The next minute, status is 'typing...'\
My heart becomes an engine\
Heartbeat touching to the prime\
I can't wait for what will she write\
Even I know it it will be just 'Hi'\
I am like sitting in the singularity\
Time has refused to go ahead now.\
  \
And finally, the moment has arrived \
The greatest scene is in my eyes\
I can see the message she has sent \
And it is not other than just a 'Hi' \
But for me, it is getting the heaven \
I almost jump in the excitement\
But 'online' status has disappeared\
I type 'How are you?' in the box.\
  \
The process repeats from the start\
I stare at the heart with her name\
I have put while saving her contact\
She replies just 'I am doing good.'\
There is not any 'What about you?'\
But I can't stop myself from writing\
I write 'I am also doing good.'\
Even I know she doesn't care for me.\
  \
I kill the time staring at the heart\
The status changes to 'online'\
But there was no 'typing...' there\
She sees my message and ignores\
She fears to open the chat \
She doesn't want ticks to turn blue\
The online status disappeared again. \
  \
I know she has ignored my messages \
But I am still waiting for the reply.\
I know she knows that I love her\
That's why she is ignoring me\
To show that she doesn't love me.\
But this made my mood happier\
At least\
She gave me attention \
not to give me attention!
