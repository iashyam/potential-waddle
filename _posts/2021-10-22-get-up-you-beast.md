Get up you sleeping beast\
Go, look at the mirror at least.\
  \
I know you are heartbroken\
I know your faith is faded\
But you have got the potential \
To change what has been decided.\
Wipe your eyes, clench your feast\
It's time to change your fate\
Get up a heartbroken beast. \
  \
Who does shall be remembered\
Who thinks shall be forgotten\
None asks who the hell you are\
What matters is what've you done.\
That's the thing always persist \
Get up and act you lazy beast\
Look who is with you\
He is with you Jesus Christ\
Get up you flying beast.\
  \
See, the sun is shining bright\
The sun is brighter than light\
This situation is very tight\
Get up, you have to fight. \
The loneliness is dangerous \
Don't put your life at a risk.\
Get up you sleeping beast.
