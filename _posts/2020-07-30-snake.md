Today a snake entered my house  
 Mother told me to kill the snake  
 I said I can not kill a creature  
 It is against the law of nature  
 She said that It harms humans  
 It has venom so poisonous    
 I said yes, but only if we pretend  
 to torture a snake till its life end  
 It tries to help itself from us  
 S It uses its attack so poisonous.  
 But it has entered our residence  
 We have to attack it in our defense  
 I said we had destroyed its home  
 That's why it entered here, my mom.  
 She said we couldn't risk it  
 You will have to understand a bit.  
 It would go away. It is just afraid  
 Why should we want to make it dead?  
 Trying to kill it is just nonsense  
 It will go away. Give it a chance.  
 My mother said that I was gone mad  
 It is so crucial to make it dead  
 I asked my mother a simple question  
You are afraid because a snake is a snake  
humans are dangerous because they are fake  
Don't some humans kill other humans?  
Why don't we consider them murderous?  
My mother said that we have connections  
We have set up so many communications.  
We, humans, share some common relations  
I said that is the key to misunderstanding  
We have actually lost the understanding  
We have ruined our relations with nature  
Why have we become enemies of creatures  
We should try to understand the system  
The Christ had created it with wisdom  
We should at least try to live in peace  
Friendship is the key to our happiness.  
Whatsoever, The snake was killed by mom  
Shyam was upset, so he wrote this poem.
