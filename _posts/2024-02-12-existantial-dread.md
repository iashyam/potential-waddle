![Carve yourself](assets/existantial-dread-1.jpg "Carve Yourself")

Nothing is real except the existential dread! \
What is it that keeps me awake late?\
The insecurity of ending up alone\
Or turning into someone I hate\
Alike the fear of known and unknown\
Or the burden of finding my fate.\
Or the simple question of\
Why haven't I yet found a date?\
Nothing is real except the existential dread!

Too forgetful of my own achievements\
Or too ungrateful of God's grace\
It may be hard work, maybe luck\
Can't figure out which is the case!\
Changing the course of action\
Or going where life leads?\
That is the prime question.\
And the essence of deeds.\
It's easier done than said\
Nothing is real except existential dread.

So what's the plan?\
The plan is to plan, I suppose\
The purpose of life\
Is to find out life's purpose.\
Don't follow what they say\
And to find your destination\
Make your own way\
And make it through exploration\
Let the sun rise; let the dream fade\
Because nothing is real except existential dread.
