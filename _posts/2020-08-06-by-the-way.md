Hi!\
By the way, what is your name?  
I remember your name is.. sam.  
Excuse me!  
It is not sam, It's Shyam Sunder  
Did I meet you in the book fair?  
Oh yes!  
You were in red sweater, Right?  
The shirt was light red or white.  
Correct!  
We bought the same book there  
It was a nice and good book fair.\
  \
By the way\
Where is your college canteen?\
We should have coffee, I mean.\
_Come_\
_I will take you there  if you say_\
_And we call it Cafe, by the way._\
Sure!\
By the way, It is not much walk\
I came Stephans to attend a talk.\
Oh Good!\
Would you like tea? By the way, \
Don't worry about it. I will  pay.\
Thank you\
Your college building is so good\
You should also talk some, dude.\
_By the way_\
_Tell me what is the talk all about_\
_I will help the venue to found out._\
Ah!\
It is something as physics tutorial\
_Do you mean the Popli Memorial?_\
Oh Yes!\
Hey, I want to say you look smart\
And this is how the stories start.\

  \
By The Way\
To Be Continued...\
