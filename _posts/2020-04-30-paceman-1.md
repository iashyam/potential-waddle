I asked myself\
Is there need of any caption\
Is there need of any quote.\
And I answered myself\
No! There isn't any need\
Fast bowling is something that\
That give me reflection of my life\
That give me confidence\
That tells me importance of palns\
That tells me how to set aims\
That tells me to give strength to work\
That makes me to believe on fortune\
It is what makes be believe that\
I can do that people say you don't.\
