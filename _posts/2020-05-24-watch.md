She was the prettiest girl of my class. And the way she talks, who couldn't fall in love with her. We were good friends. One day she shared my batch. I called her as I wanted to tell my feelings. I looked her watch. The chain was similar to mine, which I bought of â‚¹300 last year with the cash prize of a Compition. I smiled.

It showed 'fossil'. I smiled again.

"Nothing" I said.

Next day she shared batch with me. I looked her watch, it was different, still 'fossil' the chain won't similar to mine. I smiled. We were good friends. ðŸ˜Š
