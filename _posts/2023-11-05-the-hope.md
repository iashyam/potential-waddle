Hope is the heaviest weight we carry  
Hope is the toughest love to sustain.  
  
Hope is the shiniest bowl in my room  
Hope is the most fragile bowl in my room.  
  
Every time it breaks, I sit in the night  
By the candlelight  
And I patch it with the glue of a poem.  
Then I go out in search of stones.  
  
Hope is the most innocent one  
It rises and floats and dances  
In the absence of the conscious one.  
When I come back  
I find it broken again.  
  
I sit by the candlelight  
I patch it again with a new poem.\
Altered so many times that  
It has forgotten its natural shape.  
The neural network in my brain  
Has recognized a pattern  
Every time, hope rises  
It will break!  
  
But the bowl of hope  
Shines in the candlelight  
Hoping for a miracle.  
  
Hope is my over in the field  
They prevent me from going there.  
I barely recovered from a shoulder injury  
That I broke my leg last night  
They had to cut it off.  
My doctor says I can't play cricket again.  
I limp to the field.  
My shoulders are still sore  
For hope is the heaviest weight I carry.  \
Hope is the Potter's masterpiece  
But it rains every time he puts it to dry.  
The masterpiece turns into clay again  
I go and collect the clay  
And put it on the chalk in the candlelight.  
For working on the masterpiece  
And watching it turn into clay again.  
  
I hold the ball cross-seam in my hand  
For all the shine of my life is long gone.  
I know what's going to happen next  
I will crash under the weight of hope  
And they will cut my other leg.  
Then the hand and the other hand  
One by one, I will give my parts away  
I will vanish into the cruel hope breaking world  
And I will die alone in desperation.  
  
But my sole attempt is  
That hope should not die before me  
Hope should live near my deathbed  
For there is no life without hope.
