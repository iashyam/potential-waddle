---
Oh My Friend, Oh my friend\
Don't be afraid, Don't be scared\
I am not going to beat you\
Are you going to bite me? \
No.. No.. Not say dared\
Oh my friend, Don't be afraid. \
  \
Listen we are friends \
Both are created by same god\
Don't bark on me dude\
You are making me scared \
Oh my friend, Don't be afraid. \
  \
Friend! We are homemates\
We are living in same home \
I'll listen all your sorrows\
I'll tell you all my sorrows \
I'll follow whatever I have said\
Oh my friend, Don't be afraid. \
  \
I know human behaviour \
It is not worth faith but\
I am your friend \
Are you my friend? \
Why are your eyes wet? \
Oh my friend, Don't be afraid.\
