The first song on album Juda 3 is 'Chal Jindiye'. The lyrics are penned by Bir Singh and music is given by as expected Dr. Zeus. When I first listened to this song I felt this from the heart. This seems like a holy song but the rhythm is so great that everyone from the young to old generation would like it. The lyrics are so well written by Bir Singh. It is a poem addressed to the life (Jindiye) to wake up and start a journey to the ultimate city. If I have to rate this song on a scale of 0 to 10 I would like to give it three thousand stars. The flow of the voice is so smooth that you would find yourself lost in it as soon as you hit the play button.

This song is not a song it is a Vaani in modern form. This song has put a greater impact on me. It inspires us to see the reality that all the things we are chasing are not going to lead us to happiness. It is just a mirage that will go as far as we try to chase it. The place of happiness will not require any money. The guard of that place is strict, he doesn't let us bring anything in and we have to leave the load of ego outside. 

One line that has put a greater impact on me is ਨਾ ਰੱਬ ਬੰਦੇ ਵਿੱਚ ਫ਼ਰਕ ਹੋਵੇ'  that means in that ultimate city there is no difference between God and human. They all live together eat together. A line from scripture comes to my head when I read this line- God loves us he is ready to embrace us. After all, I am strong of the fact that Gods are like humans it's their good deeds that make them God. 

The other thing I liked about this song so much is that the caption is written in Punjabi. Above all things, there is a slogan 'Kisan Ekta Zindabad.' Then all the lyrics are written in Punjabi and they have provided translation in English. The lyrics are so great written by Bir Singh. I personally am a fan of Bir Singh's writings, the element of Virsa never ends in his songs and they are equipped with spirituality. If you notice the metaphors he used are so related to the land of Punjab. I am very happy that he chose Bir Singh as a musician. 

I don't personally like Dr. Zeus as a musician. But after listening to this song I think I need to change my mind. The constant flute in the background impresses me a lot. The music keeps the lyrics hold together. And there is the right amount of music in it. 

And one thing I noticed about in it. There is a mistake by Amrinder Gill. When he says '_eh gathri bhar sire te lah ke sutt guman kude.'_ You see that '_Guman"_ doesn't rhym with '_door'_ it should be '_guroor'._ IF you will check the lyrics in description you will find it right. 

  

ਚਲ ਜਿੰਦੀਏ, ਚਲ ਜਿੰਦਿਏ ਚਲ ਉੱਠ ਚੱਲੀਏ, ਤੁਰ ਚੱਲੀਏ ਏਸ ਜਹਾਨੋਂ, ਓਸ ਨਗਰ ਵੱਲ ਦੂਰ ਕੁੜੇ । ਮਨ ਮੰਦਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਸਿਆਹ ਹਨੇਰਾ ਕਰੀਏ ਨੂਰੋ ਨੂਰ ਕੁੜੇ । ਚਲ ਜਿੰਦੀਏ, ਚਲ ਜਿੰਦਿਏ ਚਲ ਉੱਠ ਚੱਲੀਏ, ਤੁਰ ਚੱਲੀਏ ਏਸ ਜਹਾਨੋਂ, ਓਸ ਨਗਰ ਵੱਲ ਦੂਰ ਕੁੜੇ । ਓਸ ਨਗਰ ਦਰਬਾਨ ਸਖ਼ਤ ਕੁਝ ਨਾਲ ਲੈ ਜਾਣ ਨੀ ਦਿੰਦੇ । ਹਉਮੈ ਦੀ ਪੰਡ ਬਾਹਰ ਲਵਾਹ ਲੈਣ ਅੰਦਰ ਲਿਆਉਣ ਨੀ ਦਿੰਦੇ । ਇਹ ਗਠੜੀ, ਭਾਰ ਸਿਰੇ ਤੇ ਲਾਹ ਕੇ ਸੁੱਟ ਗਰੂਰ ਕੁੜੇ । ਚਲ ਜਿੰਦੀਏ, ਚਲ ਜਿੰਦਿਏ ਚਲ ਉੱਠ ਚੱਲੀਏ, ਤੁਰ ਚੱਲੀਏ ਏਸ ਜਹਾਨੋਂ, ਓਸ ਨਗਰ ਵੱਲ ਦੂਰ ਕੁੜੇ । ਚੱਲ ਜਿੰਦੀਏ, ਚੱਲ ਉੱਡ ਚੱਲੀਏ ਖੰਭ ਲਗਾ ਕੇ ਗੀਤਾਂ ਦੇ, ਨਾ ਸਚ ਤੇ ਝੂਠ ਦਾ ਤਰਕ ਹੋਵੇ ਨਾ ਰੱਬ ਬੰਦੇ ਵਿੱਚ ਫ਼ਰਕ ਹੋਵੇ ਨਾ ਚੱਕਰ ਪੁੰਨ ਪਲੀਤਾਂ ਦੇ । ਓਸ ਨਗਰ ਵੱਲ ਤੁਰਦੇ ਜਿਹੜੇ ਮੁੜਦੇ ਨਈਂ ਦੀਵਾਨੇ । ਜਿਉਂ ਘਰ ਜਾ ਕੇ ਇੱਕ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਅੱਗਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਪਰਵਾਨੇ । ਜੋ ਸ਼ੀਸ਼ਾ ਯਾਦ ਕਰਾਉਂਦੈ ਭੰਨ ਕੇ ਕਰਦੇ ਚੂਰ ਕੁੜੇ । ਚਲ ਜਿੰਦੀਏ, ਚਲ ਜਿੰਦਿਏ ਚਲ ਉੱਠ ਚੱਲੀਏ, ਤੁਰ ਚੱਲੀਏ ਏਸ ਜਹਾਨੋਂ, ਓਸ ਨਗਰ ਵੱਲ ਦੂਰ ਕੁੜੇ । Come on jindriye ( my life), get up,

let's move from this world to that far-away land.

The mind is a void of darkness,

let’s fill it with divine light.

Come on Life, get up

Let's go from this world

To that far away land.

The doorman of that place is strict,

He doesn’t allow anything to be carried along. The load of Ego has to be left outside,

To enter into that heavenly place. This bundle is a weight on your head, throw it aside. Come on life, let’s fly with the wings of the songs To the place where there is no judgment Where there is no difference between God and Man. Where there is no righteousness and no vice. Those who take this path,

they never bother to return. Just like the moths,

that fly right into the Fluorescence and die. The mirror which makes you remember the previous life, shatter it all.
