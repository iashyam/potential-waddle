Tik Take\
One more man back\
Heartbeat encreasing\
With every second passing.\
  \
Absolute pressure \
This is insane\
But the man is in middle \
With new zeal in his veins.\
  \
Oh Shot! Oh Shit\
Direct Hit\
That's it.\
Few inches short\
Four years behind.\
  \
Time stops in this memory\
Just fallen by a step\
But I feel for them\
They are the black caps\
Tik take\
Bow to the black caps!
