  \
My struggle with sleep was on peak\
When Santa sneaked into my window\
He turned around ignoring my open eyes\
And checked for a chit under my pillow.\
  \
Disappointed he faced my sad face\
"Tell me, what do you wish, little boy?\
Cycle, little aeroplane, horse, camel\
Remote-controlled car or any other toy?"\
  \
His eyes twinkled to me with sneer \
That swayed a smile on my sad face\
"Can you give me anything I want?\
Warn you, It's not a toy in my case."\
  \
"As long as it is materialistic, and fits \
I can let you have anything, my dear\
But try to keep it a little less expensive\
You know I am short of funds this year."\
  \
"Well, this is not materialistic, I guess\
Dear Santa, can you find me a girlfriend?\
I have been feeling lonely and desperate\
Can you put this suffering to an end?\
  \
Honestly, I have tried not to feel this way\
But this feeling, I can no longer avoid \
When people share their love moments\
In my heart, I feel a certain kind of void.\
  \
When I read about love in my books\
I can not help but feel jealous of it\
I can shut the book or close the show\
But I feel inside my heart is burning lit.\
  \
When I see people walk holding hands\
Or even noticing each other admiringly\
My heart craves for the love every time\
I feel inside my heart is hollow entirely.\
  \
I need someone who listens to me \
My stories, insecurities and my fears\
I want someone who comforts me\
I need someone who wipes my tears.\
  \
Someone to talk through frustration\
Who cheers me up when I am low\
I need to be associated with someone\
In dark times, who makes me glow.\
  \
I need to be associated with someone\
Mention whose name make me blush\
And I am craving it for a long time now\
That is the reason I am in such a rush.\
  \
I may sound very creep and very silly\
Feelings are real. Hope you understand\
That is my wish for Christmas, Santa\
Tell me, can you find me a girlfriend?"\
  \
Santa sighed and sat down the bed\
"I don't look like a matchmaker, do I?\
But I can advise you to open more\
Talk to people, stop being so shy.\
  \
The way you behave around girls \
I don't think you can ever get one \
To be in relationship with you, tbh.\
So wake up, get out of desperation.\
  \
Instead of thinking what you crave\
Be grateful for what you have got\
You should enjoy love of your parents\
And your friends, they love you a lot.\
  \
You always fight with your mom-dad\
And friends who always think the best\
For you. And you think you can love\
Someone you don't even know yet?\
  \
These things looks good from outside\
In reality, these things are really toxic\
If you want to be truly happy in life\
You better be away from relationships.\
  \
And you are doing quite good alone\
Don't get sad from this toxic stuff\
You don't need anyone, honestly\
For yourself, you alone are enough.\
  \
Try to fall in love with yourself, man\
You don't need what you say gf or bf\
Doesn't matter if anyone loves or not\
But You should always love yourself.\
  \
And when time comes you will see\
You will find your life filled with joy\
And I will try to find a match for you\
If any girl out there wishes for a boy."\
  \
Santa stood up, straightened his dress\
And gave me a letter and a chocolate\
"I need to visit all the houses, boy\
Permit me to leave. I am getting late."\
  \
I smiled him goodbye, opened the letter\
"Merry Christmas, Shyam!" It read\
It was the the best Christmas present\
And then my struggle with sleep ended.
