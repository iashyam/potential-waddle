I found love in strangers  
The operator of the c√°fe  
Who smiles at me every time I go there.  
The security guard at the main gate  
Who caught me smiling and talking to myself  
Or the kind librarian who asks me about my day.  
I found love in them.  
  
From the train, I remember  
I found love in strangers  
The lady who shared the food  
The young boy who played Ludo with me  
Or the person who asked my name  
Or the one who gave me some cash.  
On my way to college  
  
From the college, I remember  
I found love in strangers  
The boy who clicked my photo outside the chapel  
Or the one who showed me the way to the canteen.  
Or The girl who sits next to me in the library  
And the girl who once praised my poetry.  
The girl who returned my lost phone  
Or the boy who was playing guitar on the SCR lawn.  
  
I found love in the  
The vegetable seller who does not bargain  
Or the auto driver who describes his struggles in Delhi.  
  
I found love in the stranger  
Who wished me luck before my interview.  
The senior who helped me with the code  
The examiner who was kind enough not to fail me in the practicals  
And the TA, who increased one mark on my request.  
  
I found love in all the people  
Who sits and listens to my stupid poem  
All of you gathered to write about love.  
I don't have the one person who makes me feel loved  
But I have too many to count and I am still counting.
