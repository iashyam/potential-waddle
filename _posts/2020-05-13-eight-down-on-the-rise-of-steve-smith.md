 \
Warner, Aged and taken\
Brings Steve Smith in,\
His thoughts are high\
Revenge in his eyes,\
Stuart Broad's eyes blink\
As He does in & out swing,\
But he takes it? No way!\
Raise bat & let it pass away.\
  \
Wickets are down other end\
but they aren't finding stand,\
Eight are down, still going on\
They've brought Nathon Lyon, \
They are trying to get nineth\
But they can't get out Smith, \
Jimmy-Stuart has lost hope\
Root has appointed O. Pope,\
So are coming tenser things\
Steve is building his inning. \
  \
He is batting without attraction     \
He don't mind what's situation, \
Leave, leave, run single double \
English bowlers are in trouble, \
Steve gets fifty and still playing \
'Smith is back', Joe Root saying, \
He leaves a ball with expression \
Enjoys batting in every condition, \
Leave, leave, duck, duck and dot \
He loves playing drives, cut shot. \
  \
Pace bowlers being back brought \
England is facing wicket drought, \
Steve Smith plays without risk\
Step out and hit a huge long six, \
They bowl short he pulls it away\
He gets his century at end of day, \
The next day he continues batting\
He rarely  lofts and big six hitting. \
He got LBW as the players shout \
Reviews it and safely called not out. \
  \
He bats, bats and bats, didn't stop\
He washed away England's hope, \
For the Aussies he brings a glory\
As he completes  double century, \
The score is crossed four hundred \
Steve has lofted the ball into stand, \
Now Australians have done it fix, \
Steve Smith pulls away for a six, \
At last the non striker got out\
Steve made his highest not out.\
