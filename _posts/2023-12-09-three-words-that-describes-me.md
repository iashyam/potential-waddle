title: Three Words That Describes Me
---
So there was a wellness serway in IIT last year. It was a compulsory interview to attend, at first it didn't look like I was going to attend that. I didn't like the idea of being questioned by a stranger on very personal topics. I didn't like the idea of sharing my fears and anxieties with someones I barely knew. But since, It was compulsory I somehow attended it, and after attending the first interview, I liked it so much that I attended it once again next month. 

I felt a new kind of freedom, I found out that I could confide in those strangers because they are not going to make fun of me. They are not going to remind me after I reach the peaceful state what I said to them in private. Above all of this, they have got supernatural powers, of not only listening attentively but also making you talk. They made me explore the untouched corner of mind. They made me look at myself from different angles. They made me think. I am really grateful to IITM authorities for this golden opportunity. 

One of the lady who was interviewing me asked a very common question. I didn't have an immediate answer to that question but I pondered about it for a long time after getting out the interview room. The question was very simple:

"Describe yourself in three words."

I went through the whole of my life slowly and chose three words that would describe me. There they are:

1\. Overcautious.
