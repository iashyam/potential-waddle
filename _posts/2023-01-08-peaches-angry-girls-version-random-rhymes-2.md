I love peaches. I love myself  
You got yourself, babe. I got myself  
There are unread books on my shelf  
I am mine, not yours. You punk-ass elf!  
  
When I hear you say my name  
I despise that sound  
Air becomes thick  
When you are around.  
It becomes hard to breathe  
Can you please  
Let me live in peace.  
There is something  
I want you to show  
I think I hate you  
But you don't know.  
You don't know what  
You are doing to me  
I don't like you even a bit  
Are you blind to see?  
It's irritating; I don't like it anymore  
But you don't understand  
Stubborn to your core.  
My mind lets out a frown  
Always at your sight  
I can give anything  
To get you off my mind  
I'm telling you for the last time  
That sweetie, it's time  
For you to stop trying.  
  
I love peaches. I love myself  
You got yourself, babe. I got myself  
There are unread books on my shelf  
I am mine, not yours. You punk-ass elf!
