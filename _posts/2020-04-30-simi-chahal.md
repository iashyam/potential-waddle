It has been three years   \
Since I met you first time;\
After that I have given you\
Many songs and the rhyme. \
I donated myself to write about \
You, Your beauty, your voice;\
You are the only material of \
My stories, articles and poems. \
I tried to write you but I can't \
My words finished in the short;\
People say I am crazy after you \
But I know well that I am not. \
You are my identity somewhere \
You are the reason of my smile;\
Your photo is my wallpaper \
And also photo of my profile. \
Your cute face is like elixir\
Your smiling is rain in desert;\
Your voice is like sound of soul \
I love you with my heart infect. \
I never miss any of your film \
I never miss any of your story;\
I like every post of your page\
Your photo brings me glory. \
My all friends know about you\
Without you my  life is so dull;\
I can declare ofically for you\
I am Shyam, I love Simi Chahal.\
