I take the bat in my hands\
I go ro to the crease looking stumps\
I focus on the ball and bowler\
I try to hit it with full fase of bat\
That is my love that is Cricket.\
  \
I take the ball in my hands\
I put my leading fingers on seam\
I focus on the stumps and batsman\
I try to end up everytime with a wicket\
That is my love that is Cricket\
  \
I take the position at right point\
I, myself to concentrate on every ball\
I focus on every ball coming to me\
I try to grab the ball with good rate\
That is my love that is Cricket\
  \
I take the phone in my hands\
I collect things for not standing again\
I focus on the game going on in\
I try to learn to play well from it\
That is my love that is Cricket\
  \
I take the pen & Book in my hands\
I go to the class to take a seat\
I focus on the teacher and concept\
I try to focus not away concentrate\
That is my love that is Cricket\
