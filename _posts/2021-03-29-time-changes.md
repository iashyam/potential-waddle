Time changes, people change  
Change their expressions  
Emotions changes, words change  
Change their interpretations!

  
There was a time when  
You were not in my life.  
I was single but happy  
Then I chose science.

  
Science made me meet you  
When I fell in love with you!  
The day becomes so great,  
The day I talked to you.

  
Talking beings us close  
When I fell into the relationship,  
The day you didn't call me  
The day seemed no interesting. 

  
Then we talk, agree, and disagree  
Misunderstandings and chatter fights  
We break up but still love exists there  
That's why we are not able to move on.

  
Now it let me unslept in night  
The day I talk to you!  
That's how the time has changed  
That's how the effect of love has changed.
