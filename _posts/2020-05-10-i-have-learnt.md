Mom\
I remammber you, calling me for food\
And me just saying 'No!' watching TV\
Now I have learned to run on whistles\
Standing in lines and waiting for food.\
  \
Maa\
I remammber you, saying me to bath\
And me saying- "I don't want to bath"\
Now I have learned to wake up early\
& bath first, coz I won't get it vacant.\
  \
Maa\
I remammber you, calling me home\
When I was playing cricket in streets\
Now I have learned not to go to play, \
Complete my homework on Sundays.\
  \
Maa \
I remammber you, cleaning my room\
Me saying you not to disturb me, maa\
Now I have learned to clean my room \
On Sundays adjusting time to studies. \
  \
Maa\
I remammber you, saying me to sleep \
In hot afternoon n me playing Cricket \
Now I have learned to complete sleep \
In class, begging time to sleep in room. \
  \
Bebe\
I remammber me, requesting you to\
Wash and iron my uniform properly \
Now I have learned to wash it myself\
After wearing the one till two weeks. \
  \
Maa\
I remammber me, quarrelling'th you\
And crying when you beat me badly \
Now I have learned to talk 2 minutes \
In a week, keeping others in attention. \
  \
Maa \
I remammber me, saying so proudly \
I will go to 'Uphaar Hostel' far away \
Now I have learned to pack so early\
To ask every teacher about holidays.\
