  \
The Electromagnetic Waves\
Spread in the environment\
Came from the star sun...\
Making us feel hot that's heat.\
  \
Sweat \
The liquid from our body\
Making its way on our head\
Taking energy from the surface\
And Vaporising into the air\
Trying to keep us cool, that's sweat.\
  \
Nimboo Pani\
Sodium chloride and glucose \
Mixed with Citric acid in water.\
Then add some solid-state water\
That's making us feel alive.\
  \
Night...\
Sand has a low heat capacity\
So it becomes cool at night \
Stars are clearly visible in dark sky\
Making us interested in Astronomy.
