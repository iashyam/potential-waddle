  \
Love is like magic, some kind of trickery\
Which people perform on others \
And take control of their lives.\
Otherwise no girl would fall for a boy. \
  \
Love is like magic It all seems so real\
Until you decide to try it yourself.\
It only exists in books and movies.\
You know when I read a romantic book\
I label it as fantasy fiction.\
  \
Dating and democracy has the same problem\
The public is dumb.\
Given the choice between a poet and fuckboy\
who would you like to date?\
  \
Ofcourse the poet, in theory.\
If he has abs to show off\
money to buy me things.\
And yeah if he cares than it's fine\
I would love to boss things around.\
  \
Bitches be crazy sometimes\
When someone tells then \
Find a man who reads books\
Take you on a bookstore date\
They comment 'me and who?'\
  \
Find a man who likes soft music\
Taylor Swift and her lyrics.\
Who would give you Handwritten latters.\
Find a man who listens to Faiz and Faraz.\
Find a man who would make cards for you.\
And that's when I tell them 'Hey, It's me.'\
And they be like: 'What a creep.'\
  \
They all are hypocrates. \
Every girl be like \
'Oh Honey, you can impress any girl you want.'\
But not me. I love a rich fat fuckboy.\
But when every set is a null set,\
Where do we look to find an element?\
  \
Love is like magic\
It seems preplaxing and unrealistic\
But it all can be exposes\
By the science of body and money.\
  \
Love is like magic\
You can see wizard pulling lovers out of strangers\
Similar to pulling peigon out of a tablecloth\
But when you try do it yourself.\
You get something entirely different\
You get a thing: 'Just Friends.'
