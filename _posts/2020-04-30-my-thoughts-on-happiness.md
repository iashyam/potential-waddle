My Thoughts on Happieness \
  \
Want to live life...\
Don't wait for someone.\
Because there is no person\
Made for only happienesss\
Want to be real joyful..\
Don't look for any reason\
Just solo............\
Because there is no reason for Happiness \
For the joy of tomorrow\
Don't kill joy of today.\
Live your today\
Why worry for tomorrow...\
Want to enjoy your life....\
Don't wait......\
Beacuse there is no moment of happiness ..\
Whole life is full of joy.\
Want to enjoy your nature.... \
Click the joy in things\
Happening around you \
Because there is no place for happieness \
There is joy in whole world. \
