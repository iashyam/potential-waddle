  \
The friend whom did I trust\
The friend who had the faith,\
The friend who knows my secrets\
Is the person leading me to death.\
  \
The friend I can give my life for\
Become the come to take it away\
Two sides of coin is Good andÂ \
Evil And it will flip over one day.\
  \
The words that make me smile\
Have turned to be so poisonous\
The conditions I like to live in\
They have become so dangerous.\
  \
I am dead, not by any weapon\
I am killed by shock of disbelief\
Being alone is te safest situation\
Expectations can only give grief.\
  \
You are Honoured till you are useful\
Will be killed after the task is done\
Only you should be base of yourself\
Then person you can believe is none.\
