Shyam is my best friend!\
When I look at him, he smiles \
He makes me smile in every situation\
At sad times, he makes me less sad, \
But at proud moments, he makes me more proud\
All he does is make me think a little more!\
  \
In rush situations, he presents a plan, \
He makes me do things when I am lazy!\
At depressing conditions, he motivates me up\
And we celebrate together when we win!\
  \
In bad and good times, I find him with me\
When none stands by my sides, he does\
When I want so cry, he consles me\
And he also plays the music when I want to dance!
