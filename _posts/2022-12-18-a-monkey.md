Sometimes, I take the long route to hostel  
And I leave my phone at my room  
To observe the nature around me.  
  
I stare at a monkey  
Comfortably enjoying its life,  
It looks like the character of an animated movie  
Or it's the other way around.  
I don't know!  
The grasp of technology is tight.  
  
I am jealous of it  
It lives so close to the nature  
While we walk staring at our phones.  
It has go tension of marks, money or matter  
While we are crumbling under stress.  
We only only live in IIT and pay rent  
And they own it.  
  
I look at its group  
It is close to his close ones  
I turn around to see my friends;  
There ain't any  
I have not got any.  
And here is another reason to envy it.  
  
I come back to my room  
Sit near the high stack of  
Uncompleted lab reports and due assignments  
My resume draft stares back at me!  
Human life is so complicated  
Sometimes, I want to run away from it  
Sometimes, I want to be a  
Monkey.  \
