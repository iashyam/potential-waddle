  \
The god said to me that you have ability  
You are the person born to create history  
Don’t be too much impatient, my boy  
I have thought bigger things for you.  
  
The girl, you are asking me, I tell you  
She hasn’t done good deeds to get you  
I have created someone special for you  
You should wait for her to come, though.  
Don’t be too much impatient, my boy  
I have thought bigger things for you.  
  
The car, you are asking me, isn’t good  
It is too much cheap for a person as you  
I have seen more expensive car for you  
But you have to earn for it to buy, though  
Don’t be too much impatient, my boy  
I have thought bigger things for you.  
  
The home, you are asking me, I tell you  
It is too short to live for a person like you  
I have seen more beautiful place for you  
You have to explore and make it, though  
Don’t be too much impatient, my boy  
I have thought bigger things for you.  
  
The job, you are asking me, I tell you  
Something great, you are supposed to do  
You are born to the welfare of humanity  
But you have to be strong for it, though  
Don’t be too much impatient, my boy  
I have thought bigger things for you.
