 \
When it rains in morning\
I am little bit more happy \
Because I get more time to \
complete sleep and dream.\
  \
When it rains in afternoon\
I enjoy so much to be wet in water,\
I sing, dance and jump in rainwater \
I forget all stress or responsibilities. \
  \
When it rains in evening\
I sit in a corner and just watch\
It raining on trees near the canal \
And discover title of a new poem. \
  \
When it rains in Night \
I am afraid of loosing my sleep\
I put my self into the blanket \
And listen carefully sound of rain. \
  \
When it rains in late night \
I become little bit frustrated \
Putting the things in outside \
It disturbed my sleep & dream. \
  \
When it rains in winter \
I thank god for this pleasure \
It is so good for the wheat crop \
Which will fulfill someone's hunger. \
  \
When it rains just after sowing \
I become little bit angry with god \
Because it has smashed out all\
The crops along with our hopes. \
  \
When it rains in summer\
I become very much happy \
Now the environment is colder \
And I can play cricket with friends. \
  \
When it rains on  Saturdays\
This is the best day to rain \
Because it is auspicious to rain\
And I get dilicious 'Gulgula' to eat. \
  \
When it rains with hailstorm \
I cry and weep thinking conditions\
And I pray to God for not doing this \
Because it completely vanishes crops.
