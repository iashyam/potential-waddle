 \
When you smile\
You make me smile\
When you cry\
You make me cry .\
I like your every action \
But I don't know why?\
I am full with you\
Without you I am null \
Hpy B'day Simi Chahal. \
  \
Your sweet voice is so soft \
That I can listen it infinitly;\
Your cute face is so attractive \
That I can watch it infinitly. \
You are very much  beautiful\
None can beat you in fashion;\
We have met rarely in reality \
We meet daily in imagination. \
You are in my mind and skull \
Happy birthday Simi Chahal. \
  \
Your hairs are blacker than night\
Every colour suits as your dress;\
You are like any celebrity to me\
You are my the  favourite actress. \
You made me interested in films \
I bought, for you, Amazon prime;\
Whenever I want to watch movie\
I only & only watch you everytime.\
You are my one and only humble\
Happy Birthday to Simi Chahal. \
  \
You are inspiration to my poems \
Your name is associated with me;\
You live always in my thoughts\
You are heroine of my short story .\
Your acting always impresses me \
While watching you I have fun ;\
You are my first and only crush\
At least until I get any real one. \
Without you my life is so dull \
Happy birthday Simi Chahal.\
