title: 'Dune: A Haibun'
---


There is another dune after that one, but it doesn't catch my attention; this one is my favourite. The dune sits there cold in the morning, shining bright in the afternoon, and tired in the evening, just like me. He is home to many snakes and other vanomous reptiles, similar to insecurities and fears in my head. He goes through storms, rains, and sunshine but absorbs everything and remains still and in shape, just like I do. In the evening, we get together, talk about our day, and watch sunset together. He listens to my poems and stories attentively and never gets bored.

> I find a buddy\
> In the still yellow sand dune\
> But none in humans.
