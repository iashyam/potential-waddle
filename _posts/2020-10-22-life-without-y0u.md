Love Poem  \

When I stood up at a height\
Taking the beautiful sight\
  
Everything is so beautiful  
But I cannot see  
How beautiful would it be,  
If you would be with me.  
I would like to be out with you  
The life is incomplete without you.  
 The world is also beautiful  
That doesn’t contain you  
But deep in my heart  
One thing always remains: you.  
There is birds’ chirping and  
A lot other beautiful sound  
But everything is like noise,  
When you are not around.  
My life has only a snout: you.  
The is life is incomplete without you.  
 The slowly flowing wind  
And slowly moving plants  
Remind me that I am a loser  
I couldn’t fulfill your demands.  
Leaves are turning black  
Because they need some water  
Showing me that I am not good  
Neither as lover nor as farmer.  
You can ask me I don’t doubt you  
The life is incomplete without you.  
 The sun is about to set now  
Creating a nice beautiful view  
But I am still thinking that  
I could have spent this with you.  
We sit on the dried wood  
Letting us our lips meet  
Leaving the world behind  
Having a beautiful greet.  
Thinking this under the Neem  
I know this is just a dream.  
I think I think so much about you  
The life is incomplete without you.\
