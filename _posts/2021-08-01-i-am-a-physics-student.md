 \
I am a Physics Student\
I can take you to Mars.\
I can tell the age of universe\
Just by gazing the stars.\
  \
It may seem magic \
But it is actually science \
If you look through my eyes\
Everything will look nice.\
Nothing will look harsh!\
  \
See the light, seven colors  \
Reflection, Refraction interference \
Or see the internet, radio waves\
They are same there's no difference.\
What's the reason of twinkling stars!\
Look at Schrodinger's cat \
Dead and alive at the same time\
You can't find until you open the box\
It's funny coz it is orthoidox.\
Look at the atoms or look quarks!\
  \
Atoms in random motion\
Colliding going nowhere\
Volume, temperature, pressure\
So many variables they share\
Possibilities of chain reaction\
Probabilities of throwing a dart!\
  \
Strings for attraction\
Strings for repulsion\
Strings for everything\
Here only strings have meaning\
Strings are the way to start!
