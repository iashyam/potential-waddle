A world with no borders\
  
  \
I come from a place\
A planet with no borders\
No dictators, No government\
Still, everything is in order.\
  \
There is no cast, no religion\
There are not any race\
No discrimination on creatures\
No difference on any basis.\
  \
We are all the same\
We are called gender blind\
Girls are ahead of boys\
But boys are not behind.\
  \
I come from a planet\
There aren't any crimes\
Where judiciary is a formality\
  \
All assets are public\
The public is an asset\
Service is mandatoryÂ \
No money, no questions!\
  \
No import, no export\
No empire no wars\
Love is in place of hate\
Hate is not among stars.\
  \
In this world, if we compare\
That world is fascinating\
Nuclear power is for electricity\
No atom bombs for threatening.\
  \
On our planet,\
All creatures are the same\
When we introduce ourselves\
We use the planet's name as a surname.\
  \
There all things are even\
There aren't any odds\
But one thing is strange,\
Humans are our Gods.
