It is 2 AM of dark night  
  No sign of sleep in my eye  
  It has gone away from me  
  It has abandoned me.  
   
  Sitting in balcony  
  Cigarette in my hand  
  Going through your memory  
  Letting them go away  
  With the smoke in the sky.  
   
  Sitting under the sky  
  Phone in my hands  
  Swiping through your pictures  
  My cheeks can feel the cold  
  When the breeze hits the tears.  
   
  Sitting in the cold breeze  
  Cigarette butt in my hands  
  Comparing my life with ashes  
  My happiness fly away as smoke  
  And the sorrow as ashes remains!  
   
  Sitting in a sorrow  
  My face in my hands  
  Yes, I am crying after you  
  Because at this stage  
  That is all what I can do!  
   
  I am thankful to you  
  For the life you have given me  
  At least I have experience to fail!  
  Thank you!
