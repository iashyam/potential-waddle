My life is like a play  
 It’s not dark but gray   
I am waiting for a day  
 When I’ll be able to say.  
  
  
 I have feelings for you   
They are heartly true   
I want to live with you  
 I want to die with you.  
  
  
 My love is pretty strange   
It makes me very tense   
The fact that I can’t get you   
But my love can’t be changed.  
  
  
Your beauty is like snow  
 I love you I know you know  
 You keep ignoring me tough   
But I am not going with flow.  
  
  
 My love is above anything   
For my life it is like spring  
 It is in the poems I do write   
It’s in the songs I like to sing.  
   
 For you my eyes don’t blink  
 Tears are what I like to drink  
 I got excited for you when  
 Whenever I find there’s a link.
