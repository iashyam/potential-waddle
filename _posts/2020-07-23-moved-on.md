 Now the butterflies don't remind me  
The bad past,  I have left behind me.  
I have stopped crying  for my future  
I have started to find out  my nature.  
I am happy, The worst time is gone:  
I have forgotten you, I've moved on.  
  
I am grown, I have started working  
I don't take so pressure of anything.  
I have stopped  taking so much tips  
I don't think about  so relationships.  
I have decided  to let me live alone:  
I have forgotten you, I've moved on.  
  
I have started using time so wisely  
I am taking so much care of family  
I have finally  returned  to my nest  
I think  everything will be the best.  
I have  found your falseness shown  
I have forgotten you, I've moved on.  
  
I've  entered in the world of reality  
I have already left every of facility  
I have now started explorin myself  
In the rest frame  talking to myself.  
I don't spend  much time on phone  
I have forgotten you, I've moved on.
