 \
How many birthday wishes did you get?\
None.\
But I finished a book\
Watched a movie\
I actually had fun.\
Does it make sense?\
But I like to live alone.\
I have no complaints.\
  \
Why don't you hang out with friends?\
I don't have any.\
My classmates?\
I don't even know their names\
But they study with you.\
You are the same.\
Yeah but they don't like me\
I don't like them. \
I am happy alone\
I don't need any friends.\
I like my life \
I have no complaints.\
  \
You have got issues\
Everyone has\
Why do couples sit beside me\
They don't have any other place?\
You think I am jealous\
No that's not the case \
But I am embarrassed\
I have to hide my face.\
  \
Why do people argue where I am reading\
Can't they find another place?\
Lawns, gazebo, cafe\
Moon Mars Jupiter\
Or any corner of space?\
They don't\
It's okay\
I will put earphones in my defence\
I like my life\
I have no complaints.
