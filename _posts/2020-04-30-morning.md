 \
When the sun don't show off \
It is beautiful to be in 'Razai'\
To say my maa to bring 'chai'\
To stuck head in science doubts\
To eat the delicious peanuts  \
To discuss with brothers about goals\
To take heat from the burning coals\
To listen stories of grandmother \
To make make face on bathing\
To collect cotton for more something. \
