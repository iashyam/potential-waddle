Believe in yourself  
You can do What you want to  
If you want to do it  
No one can stop you.  
Nothing is important  
If you are trying for it  
How can't be it happen  
If you are dying for it.  
If you are failing then  
find a different way  
failure is important  
No matter what people say.  
If people are making fun of you  
Think you are going right  
The same people will follow you  
Once you have reached the height  
Don't think what don't you have  
Make wise use of available resources  
God is there for you  
It will handle all the bad forces.  \
