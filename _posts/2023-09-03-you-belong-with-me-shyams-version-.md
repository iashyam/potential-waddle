You Belong with me (Shyam's Version)\
   \
I watch you standing there \
Fighting with your boyfriend\
You use your hands to a good affair\
Just to make him understand \
But he doesn't get it like I do. \
I am sitting with my sketchbook\
It's one of those lazy days\
I sketch you in a happy look\
You stand here with a sad face.\
He doesn't want you happy like I do. \
I want you so badly\
To come and sit with me\
To cry on my shoulder\
While I try to console you  \
But you walks away in the other direction.\
I sit here alone \
Dreaming about the day \
When you wake up and find\
What you have looking for \
Has been here the whole time. \
If you can see that \
I am the one who understands you\
Been here all along so why can't you see\
You belong with me. \
  \
Walking the streets with your one and only\
He is looking at a girl from the corner of eyes\
I am wandering there listening to music \
When you give me a friendly smile. \
That reminds me of your smile\
That used to win the whole town \
I haven't seen that in a while \
Since he has brought you down. \
Just thinking why don't you leave\
But anyway, why will you choose me?\
  \
Because you wear high heels\
I wear slippers\
You are such an angel\
I am just a failure. \
But still wishing you realize my love and find\
What you have looking for \
Has been here the whole time. \
If you can see that \
I am the one who understands you\
Been here all along so why can't you see\
You belong with me. \
  
Oh remember us sitting by the library \
Exchanging poems and stories\
You were happy on the contrary.\
Away from the world of glories.\
You told me about your childhood\
And you described your dreams\
I know where you belong \
And I think it's with me!\
Just open your eyes and see baby\
You belong with me\
Have you ever thought maybe\
You belong with me!\
