title: 'Drowned '
---
I am feeling so drowned\
In the deep ocean of feelings\
Because I have cheated\
With my family, myself too.\
I am lost in the darkness\
Every direction is so black\
I don't know where to go\
Everything is infinite but empty.\
I am falling towards the\
The center of a Black Hole\
Everything is dark deep and vecent\
And am just falling and falling.\
I have lost my own reputation\
My publicly in my eyes...\
I am feeling cut from myself.\
I am feeling guilty, so guilty\
As I am addicted to cheap wine.\
I have done many things wrong\
To myself, I am drown..\
But.....\
I will overcome over these feelings\
I will leave all bad habits\
I will gain my lost image\
My reputation in my eyes.\
I will develop my personality.\
My friendship with myself is broken\
But I will tie it with knote of faith.\
I will control my mind\
I won't let my mind rule over my heart.\
I will feel the feeling of responsibility,\
That I am grown up\
I should behave like an adult.\
