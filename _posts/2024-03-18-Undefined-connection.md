title: Undefined Conntection

We share an undefined connection \
I always think about being with you\
I always enjoy it when I am with you\
I don’t want to let the moment go\
I want you to stay with me always.

I want you to stay with me always\
I am different when I am with you \
I am complete when I am with you\
For me, you are a complementation\
We share an undefined connection.

I perform my best when you cheer\
I speak better whenever you hear\
I hope you would listen to me once\
For me, you are a kind of inspiration\
We share an undefined connection.

I wish I could define our relationship\
I wish I could know more about us\
I have found out that this isn’t love\
This is not the feeling people say it.\
This is the one and last conformation \
We share an undefined connection.
