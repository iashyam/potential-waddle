Uncompleted Conversations\
  \
I don't remammber when I met you first time\
I don't remammber when you come closer to me\
I don't remammber when I fell in love with you\
But I remammber when my heart was cheated\
And the conversations.. Remain uncompleted.\
  \
You know when you came to watch me play\
I did score my madain half - century that day, \
I took first Hat-trick of my first class career \
That  day when you asked for my number. \
Massages, I sent you, are seen but not replied \
So the conversations.. Remain uncompleted. \
  \
I react on your status, expect from you same\
My heartbeats go up when you call My name, \
You are like mustered grown in village field\
You are so beautiful and also very kind inside. \
The day I don't meet you goes like prisonated\
But the conversations.. Remain uncompleted.\
  \
All crime is not just yours, that is  mine too \
I compressed myself  that I don't love you, \
Now when you have given love to someone \
I am crying that you took my love as fun. \
I don't want to hate but you're being hated\
So the conversations.. Remain uncompleted. \
  \
If I have to choose you're still my preference \
Thought of you still gives good performance \
I think you can be seen behind my craziness\
You are still, surely, reason of my happiness. \
But I can't tell you. My love cannot  be rated\
And the conversations.. Remain uncompleted.\
