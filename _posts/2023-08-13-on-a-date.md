Oh Shyam! Wake up\
It's Thursday \
Go to the shrine\
Your beloved waits, midway. \
  
Last night, it rained\
The environment looks freshly painted. \
The trees drop odd drops\
Vapor rises from the wet black roads.\
It's such a romantic day\
Go to the shrine\
Your beloved waits midway. \
  \
Get a rose, be an example\
From the lady's shop near the temple\
Ask the security guard for spare pennies \
Write her a letter for her happiness. \
Also write her a poem, what say?\
Go to the shrine \
Your beloved waits midway.\
Put on the grey kurta, her favorite \
And the green scarf for the heat \
Paint your nails pink, she likes that\
Take the tote bag which says: \
Poetry Advisory: Poetic Content  \
Take a calendar, mark the date\
Go to the shrine \
Where your beloved waits.\
Oh Shyam! Wake up!\
It's Thursday\
Go to the shrine \
Your beloved waits midway.
