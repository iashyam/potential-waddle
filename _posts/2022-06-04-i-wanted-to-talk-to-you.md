Â \
We say goodbye to each other\
By staring at each other\
In complete silence.\
No words spoken\
No oscillations of pressure\
Just our eyes conveying the message.\
  \
It wasn't any different than our other meetings\
We never talked to each other\
I couldn't gather the courage to initiate\
And I don't know about her side.\
But all the conversations we had\
Were started by her.\
  \
There was a lot I wanted to say her\
I wanted to say her thank you\
For making me stay in library\
Everyday till seven hence I aced.\
For letting me know\
How does it feels to fall in love.\
For introducing me to\
A new kind of sufiana ecstasy.\
  \
Few times that day\
She couraged to sit beside me\
Wanting me to initiate a conversation\
And I failed yet again.\
She is braver than me I feel.\
  \
I am kinda two faced\
I want to see her again\
I wish to encounter her again\
And she does encounter me\
I fail to talk to her again.\
  \
I wish I had said her a proper good bye\
I wish I had sing her a Sufi song.\
I wish I had asked her one of the questions.\
I wish she reads this poem\
And she get to know that it was not one sided\
It just didn't come out.\
  \
She liked the poem of stories\
And this story of mine and hers\
Was the one that ended before starting.
