  \
I got rid of my phone\
I was walking alone¬†\
Enjoying my life a little too much\
When I heard something crunch\
Under my feet, like a shell\
I look down¬†\
I had killed a snail.\
  \
I looked down\
Terrorized little creature\
Waiting for death\
Which came at a snail's pace\
It spoiled my happy mood\
Guilt took over my face.\
I was so sorry for the loss\
I apologized to the stillness\
But it was beyond repair\
It can not be given forgiveness.\
  \
People sometimes\
Step on your shell\
Without knowing that\
They are stepping on your shell\
But none has a sole purpose\
Of making your life a living hell.\
You should know that\
You can't live with¬†\
Despise in your heart\
Forgive them, let it go...\
Have a new fresh start!
