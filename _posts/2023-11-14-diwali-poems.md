Poem 1:  
----------
I go out and wander late night  
Stand in the amazement of lights.  
I clean and decorate my adobe  
Rearrange clothes in the wardrobe.  
I make cards and posters  
Putting Diyas, photos, and figures.  
  
I worship, I dance, I sing  
I try every possible thing  
To veil the eternal sadness  
Because I need to confess  
This isn't home  
And this isn't Diwali.Â

Poem 2  
---------
When even some distance relative dies  
My family doesn't celebrate Diwali  
Neither does any other family  
If their distant relative has died.  
If you can a walk along the road  
You can tell by looking at the decorations  
Which family has lost a beloved one  
  
I had always objected to that  
Why should I hold my celebration  
I barely knew that person.  
And my mother tells me that  
It's to respect a human life  
It's to show god that we know the value.  
Such were the teachings of my mother.  
  
Years later, I stand on the eve of Diwali  
None of my distant relatives has died  
But I am in no mood to celebrate  
I don't celebrate Diwali  
Because I know the value of human lives  
Of innocents being murdered  
In the war of the religion.
