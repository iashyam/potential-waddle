title: 'Being With Myself '
---
All the things in world are relative\ 
I am in the rest frame of myself;\ 
In the journey to explore the life\ 
I am not alone I am with myself.\ 
  \ 
When I am happy, I be with myself\ 
I be happy, When I be with myself;\ 
When I am sad, I be with myself\ 
But not sad, when I be with myself.\ 
In the journey to explore the life\ 
I am not alone, I am with myself.\ 
  \ 
The person who knows me the most\ 
The person who loves me the most\ 
The person whom I love the most\ 
Is not anyone else, but is myself.\ 
In the journey to explore the life\ 
I am not alone, I am with myself.\ 
  \ 
In every situation, I needed help\ 
In problems when I'm in trouble\ 
In exams when my mind don't work\ 
Who helps me? that is only myself.\ 
In the journey to explore the life\ 
I am not alone, I am with myself.\ 
  \ 
When IÂ  think about the world\ 
When I want to live in the world\ 
When I go deepest in thoughts\ 
I fiund only and only myself\ 
In the journey to explore the life\ 
I am not alone, I am with myself.
