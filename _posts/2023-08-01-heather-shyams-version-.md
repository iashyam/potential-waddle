\
I still remember \
The third of December\
Me in her sweater \
She said it looked better\
Then it did at her.\
Only if she knew\
How much I liked her\
My dark days glow brigher\
Only if I catch sight of her.\
I watch her as she walks by\
What a sight for sore eyes\
Brighter than the blue skies.  \
She has got me mesmerized\
She looks at me while I die. \
Why would she ever kiss me\
I am not even half as pretty \
She gave me her sweater\
But it's just polyester. \
Perhaps, she didn't like sweater \
And she doesn't like me either\
I wish I were with Heather. \
 \
Now she is standing behind me\
I don't even look at her\
How could I hate her\
God maybe took ages\
For just to create her. \
Those pretty conversations\
Awkward situations. \
I don't have a label \
For our relation\
How I am under tension  \
We're no more than just friends.\
But that changes as she walks by\
What a sight for sore eyes\
Brighter than the blue skies.  \
She has got me mesmerized\
She looks at me while I die. \
Why would she ever kiss me\
I am not even half as pretty \
She gave me her sweater\
But it's just polyester. \
Perhaps, she didn't like sweater \
And she doesn't like me either\
I wish I were with Heather. \
  \
She stands beside me\
Her arm over my shoulder\
Now I am getting colder. \
How could I take her\
She is such an angel\
I am just a failure \
My feelings get stranger. \
  \
She looks at me with confused eyes\
Mixed look of love and strong shines \
Brighter than the blue skies\
She has got me mesmerized\
She holds my hand being shy.  \
  \
Time stops as she kiss me\
She made me feel so pretty.\
It's not about the sweater \
She knew that I love her\
And she too is my lover.\
Oh God, I am with Heather!
