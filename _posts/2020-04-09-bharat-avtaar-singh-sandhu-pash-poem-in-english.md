India -

The greatest word of honor in my eyes 

Wherever it is used

All other word seems meaningless

  

Meaning of this word is related to

The sons of Indian land

Who, till now, by shadows of trees

Measure the time. 

They don't have any problem expect stomach

And when they are hungary

They can eat their own parts

For them life is a tradition

And the meaning of death if Freedom. 

  

Whenever anyone talks about 

Indian Regional Unity 

My heart says that I 

Throw his hat in the air

And tell him 

That meaning of India 

Is not related to any 'Dushyant' 

But it is to the fields 

Where the food grows up. 

  

~Avtaar Singh Sandhu 'Paash'
