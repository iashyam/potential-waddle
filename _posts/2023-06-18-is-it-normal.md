Is it normal\
To talk to yourself\
In hushed voice\
In a public place?\
Even in the noise\
It invites some stares.\
Is it normal\
While humming a song\
To start doing movement\
And start dancing along?\
To start enjoying present.\
Even that invites some stares\
People watching, you're unaware.\
  \
Is it normal\
To stop in the midway\
And just admire the flower?\
Take pictures of pretty sky.\
And point and recognize the stars?\
  \
Is it normal for a boy\
To own an amount of stationary\
To be interested in poetry\
To paint his nails\
To cry when he fails\
To be submerged in books\
To be conscious of his looks\
To help his mom in kitchen \
To play board games for fun.\
  \
It is normal or it's not\
I don't really care\
I don't event give it a thought\
I don't give an f to the stares. \
I don't need any validation\
I will do what I want to do\
Even if it is abnormal action.\
You deserve to be happy Shyam.
