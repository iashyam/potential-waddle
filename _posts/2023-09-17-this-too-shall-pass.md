I love standing on a height\
Watching cars move at a distance\
Small figures come and go like\
Features of the fading face\
Of Someone we used to love.\
It's ironic to see us thriving \
Without the people we said\
We can't even live without.\
It's cruel how time heals the wound.\
Even without our cooperation.\
But when a wound is healed \
It leaves behind a mark\
A scar on the skin\
Like a link to the archives\
That brings back the story if clicked\
But this story is no longer painful\
It's an experience, a lesson learnt.\
  \
Like the cars moving at a distance\
Like the waves in the sea\
Like the clouds in the sky\
Nothing that comes, stays.\
So say yourself going through hard times\
This too shall pass\
This too shall pass.
