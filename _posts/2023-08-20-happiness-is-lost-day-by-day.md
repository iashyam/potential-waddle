Happiness is lost day by day\
How one could find its way?\
Through the pathless woods of vine  \
I have to reach to my dine.  \
One twinkling star in the twilight \
The only thing in my sight \
Forcing me to work so hard\
So that i could get my reward. \
So uneasy it is to stay alive \
If one is not cheerful in his life  \
  \
To get my achievements and my goals\
I have to drink those poisonous bowls. \
Rather than breaking down, \
I chose to stand again  \
But all my efforts now seems to be in vain  \
Or my soul will grow more depraved.  \
I need some love in place of hatred \
  \
Is there someone to share my story? \
In the dreary world of fake glory? \
Do not trust even your own blood \
They will also ruin you in the deadliest flood. \
Better to keep your problems within you \
Or you have to polish others' shoe \
They will never help you out \
Instead, will take advantage while you shout.  \

I wrote this in October 2019 and OMG I can't believe that I used to use such nice words in poems earlier. I have lost vocab the more literature I have read.
