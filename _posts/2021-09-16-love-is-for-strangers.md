I don't want to learn Spanish\
When I listen to Spanish songs\
I wonder How good the music is!\
I don't know what they mean\
But I am in love with them!\
  \
Sometimes I stare at the equations\
As a small child who is weak at maths\
And I wonder how great the Greek letters look \
Like a drawing triangle upside down with an arrow on top\
I need not bother about their meanings\
I am in love with this subject\
Besides, I have written them one minute ago!\
  \
Sometimes, I imagine myself as an ancestor\
Woken from the sleep of years and wondering \
How far science has progressed \
People communicating with little devices\
Electric powered machines, \
And you need not do anything \
I am in love with this age \
Even I don't know how to use a phone!\
  \
Sometimes, I imagine myself as an alien\
Just arrived on this planet\
I stand on a height \
Trying to see beyond my eyesight\
Blue sky and green fields\
And farmers working in the hard \
I am in love with earth \
Even I don't know what to do!\
  \
But let me be honest here\
Yes Spanish songs do sound nice\
But mathematics is freaking hard\
Hard to understand what a wavefunction means\
Radiations are spreading killing the birds and nature\
Machines are causing global warming \
And people on earth are greedy \
Farmers get nothing of all this hard work!!\
  \
But I need to love all of this\
So need to change the rest frame \
Looking from the rest frame of a stranger\
This world looks loveable \
And I am in love with this world \
Ignoring the reasons why I should not!
