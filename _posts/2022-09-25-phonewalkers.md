Walking Souls \
  \
Undiscovered, not travelled roads\
Looking as strange as one could be\
And beautiful\
As they should be!\
Souls wandering on them\
As they are familiar\
  \
They are just walking\
Staring at their palms \
They are just walking!\
  \
They know their destination\
They know their paths\
But they are not aware of the journey!\
They are alive\
But they are not living.\
Respiration is active\
But they are not breathing!\
They are just walking\
Heads down \
They are just walking.\
  \
They didn't notice\
The sky has turned grey\
Nor did they notice\
The rock coming their way.\
They don't care \
What the nightingale is singing\
And they don't vibrate\
Even the breeze is chilling!\
They are just walking\
Heads down \
They are just walking!\
  \
They don't wave or nod\
At people from other way \
They don't exchange smiles, \
They don't ask their goodwill\
They don't stop and talk\
All they do is walk\
Staring at their phones\
They keep walking. \
  \
They don't see the \
The traffic light turning red\
Stray animals wandering \
The indicator of the coming vehicle\
Or the little child\
Crossing the road alone\
Their eyes are pinned on their palms\
And they are walking\
Heads down they are walking.\
  \
They don't hear\
The irritating honks \
The whistle of the traffic police \
The cries of someone in pain\
Their ears are not vacant \
They are busy with Spotify\
And they are walking\
Looking at their palms\
They are walking \
  \
They don't sing \
The song of the passengers\
They don't wipe their faces\
Sitting under a tree.\
They don't count their heads,\
They don't measure\
The water level of their bottles.\
They don't celebrate\
At the milestones.\
They just keep walking\
Heads down\
They just keep walking.\
  \
They don't stop\
To feed the hungry bitches,\
Or to pick up the pomegranates\
Or to collect the red roses\
For the beloved one\
They are going to meet.\
They just keep walking\
Heads down \
They just keep walking!\
  \
They are not aware\
Of their bleeding feet,\
They don't bandage\
Their bloody wounds.\
They don't burn\
The corpse of their teammates.\
They just keep walking\
Hypnotized by the virtual reality\
In their hands\
They just keep walking.\
  \
They have forgotten\
The taste of the loaf,\
The color of water\
And the fragrance of food.\
They have lost \
The sense of touch\
Ability to hear\
And their vision.\
Still they are alive\
They are walking\
Heads down\
They are walking.\
  \
