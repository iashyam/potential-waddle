These long alone walks  
These long self talks  
They really help me a lot  
They develop me a lot...  
  
Lost in a day dream  
Reading under a Neem  
Or staring at flowers  
These are the happiest hours.  
  
When you recite a poem and people clap  
You gaze at them reducing the gap  
When they feel exactly what you feel  
Then it becomes a joyful deal!  
  
The café operator smiles really cute  
He knows it from my face  
Because I always ask the same thing  
And I sit at the same place.  
He knows my taste  
So gracefully, he makes my plate  
From him, I get positive vibes  
And it makes me smile.\
And you!\
You calling my name\
Shyam: the sweetest sound in the world!\
Telling me that you love my poetry  \
In the corridor beside the library.\
Your smile really snatches my heart. \
Standing so close, yet worlds apart. \
  \

This poem was written a long time ago. Ages it seems now. Those days in St. Stephen's college had been great. Today, none of these things are with me to make me happy. \
Life in IIT has been challenging. Every week is tougher than the last one. Every day comes with a powerful blow from life. Defend this, defend that. The small things which caused me joy seemed to be disappeared in the air, so I have been in search of larger things to make me happy. Oh I have just realized that. But however, if life is a challenge, I am ready to accept it. \
Milte hai next week with another old poem... tab tak ke liye.. khuda hafiz.
