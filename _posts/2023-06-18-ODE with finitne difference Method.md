title: ODE Using Finite Difference Method

In the study of differential equations, a boundary-value problem is a differential equation subjected to constraints called boundary conditions. A solution to a boundary value problem is a solution to the differential equation which also satisfies the boundary conditions.

Boundary value problems arise in several branches of physics as any physical differential equation will have them. Problems involving the wave equation, such as the determination of normal modes, are often stated as boundary value problems. A large class of important boundary value problems are the Sturmâ€“Liouville problems. The analysis of these problems, in the linear case, involves the eigenfunctions of a differential operator.

To be useful in applications, a boundary value problem should be well posed. This means that given the input to the problem there exists a unique solution, which depends continuously on the input. Much theoretical work in the field of partial differential equations is devoted to proving that boundary value problems arising from scientific and engineering applications are in fact well-posed. 

In this notebook we will be solving boundary value problem. Our problem will be 
to find the electric potential $\phi$ inside a sphere of radius $R$ with a constant charge density $\rho_o$. This sphere will obey the __Poission Equation_

![sphere](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ3J9YPnR-e9QfGJXOMIRHJmHs5O1ZpjZOvag&usqp=CAU)

$$\nabla^2\phi=-\frac{\rho_o}{\epsilon_0}$$

In our case, the charge density $\rho$ is independent of angles, so the potential has a spherical symmetry. Thus our $\phi$ will only depend of $r$ and hence we can write the above equation as: 
$$\frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr}\left( r^2 \frac{d}{dr} \phi(r)\right) = - \frac{\rho_0}{\epsilon_0}$$

Which can be further simplified into 

$$\frac{d^2 \phi}{dr^2} +  \frac{2}{r} \frac{d\phi}{dr} = - \frac{\rho_0}{\epsilon_0}$$

Now for boundary conditions: at the surface of the Sphere, the potential will look like that it's all potential is concentrated at its center. so we can calculate total charge that would be $q = 4\pi r^3/3$ so the potential at the surface would be 
$$\phi(R) = \frac{\rho R^2}{3 \epsilon_0}$$

Next boundary condition would be very easy. Because of the spherical symmetry the electric field would be zero at the center of the sphere: 
$$\frac{d\phi}{d r}\rvert_{r=0} = 0$$ 


Now we need to non-dimenssionalise our equation. The lenght scale in your problem is the radius of the sphere $R$. So we define dimessionless length $\mathcal{r} \to \frac{r}{R}$ .Our potential scale would be as $\phi_0 = \frac{\rho_0 R^2}{\epsilon_0}$ so dimessionless potential would be: $\phi \to \frac{\phi}{\phi_0}$. From this our dimessionless equation would be:

$$\frac{d^2 \phi}{dr^2} +  \frac{2}{r} \frac{d\phi}{dr} = -1$$

With the boundary conditions $E(0) = 0$ and $\phi(1) = 1/3$. And our reigon of interest would be inside the sphere that is $[0,1]$.

To solve this equation, we will use finite difference method. We will devide the interval [0,1] into $N$ small spaces. Eeach space will have the length $h$. If we write the potenial $\phi(r_i) = \phi_i$ We can write the derrivatives as following:

$$\frac{d\phi}{dr} = \frac{\phi_{i+1}-\phi_{i-1}}{2h} , \frac{d^2 \phi}{dr^2} = \frac{\phi_{i+1}+\phi_{i-1}-2\phi_i}{h^2}$$

So our diffrential equation becomes:

$$\frac{\phi_{i+1}+\phi_{i-1}-2\phi_i}{h^2} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\phi_{i+1}-\phi_{i-1}}{2h} =-1$$

or

$$\phi_{i+1} \left( \frac{1}{h^2}+\frac{1}{h r_i} \right)  + \phi_{i-1} \left( \frac{1}{h^2}-\frac{1}{h r_i} \right ) + \phi_{i} \left( \frac{-2}{h^2}\right) = -1 $$

with boundary conditions $\frac{\phi_1 - \phi_0}{h} = 0$ and $\phi_N = 1/3$.

Now unfortunately we don't have the mathematica function `NDsolve` in python. So I solved this diffrential equation on paper to compare the solution. The real solution of the problem is:

$$\phi(r) = -\frac{r^2}{6} + \frac{1}{2}, \{0 \le r \le 1 \}$$
