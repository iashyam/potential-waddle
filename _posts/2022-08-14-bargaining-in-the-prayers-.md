  \
I would meet her in the library\
Where the silence is mandatory\
We don't create a wave of pressure\
We just stare at each other.\
  \
She is as white as snow of Kashmir\
How do I compare, I haven't met Heer\
Her eyes are as deep as an ocean\
No wonder she is beautiful, she is from heaven.\
I didn't know her name, nor her course  \
The way she looks at me with strong force.\
  \
I didn't have the courage to walk to her\
When she came to me, I couldn't talk to her\
She initiated the conversations a few times\
But I couldn't convey my feelings any time.\
  \
The clock was on the counter ticking its way\
Limited time, one lesser day remained each day\
And the last day came and passed in a hurry\
I couldn't talk to her that is the biggest worry.\
  \
I good byed her by the stares \
Now I am bargaining in the prayers.\
  \
Give me one day\
I want to whisper to her, 'I love you'\
I know I can't get her, I don't want to.\
  \
Okay give me one hour\
I just want to talk to her\
I just want to listen to her soothing voice\
Which can enlighten me in all this noise.\
  \
Please just give me a minute \
Just want to get a glimpse of her\
I just want to look at her beautiful face\
Which I could remember every morning.\
  \
Give me a moment\
I just want to feel her presence\
That will give meaning to my existence.\
  \
I know I can't get even a moment\
And I have to deal with this sentiment\
  \
Falling in love is more beautiful than being in love\
And I just want to fall in her love for ever\
I don't want to meet her, talk to her, or even look at her.\
Forgetting her is really tough for me\
The fading memory of her face is enough for me \
To live for an eternity\
Love is beyond infinity\
I know how does it feel\
People have devoted life in the love of imaginary God\
At least mine is real.
